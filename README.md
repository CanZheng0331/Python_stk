This code implements an automated simulation and analysis tool using STK (Systems Tool Kit) and Python. The goal is to simulate a satellite communication system with a constellation of satellites and ground users, including scenario creation, satellite and user object generation, access computation, and data export. Several functions are defined to handle scenario initialization, simulation, computation, and data output.
